# ICODutchAuction
A Dutch auction for reselling Ethereum ICO Tokens. This works like post-ICO's ICO.

A smart contract like this be useful for hyperfinancialization and finding a marketplace for unmet demand on the sold tokens. When the tokens are sold out in an ICO, there are still some buyers who want them but can't purchase. The exchanges take few weeks to list the newly minted token for trading economy. 

This smart contract will create a trustless decentralized market economy to resell the tokens through a smart contract.
